# Railway Force Rebuild Trigger
# This file forces Railway to rebuild all services from scratch

Build timestamp: 2026-01-30 16:35 CET
Reason: Ensure entrypoint.sh is properly included in Docker image

Expected behavior:
- entrypoint.sh should be copied and made executable
- Each service should start with: 🚀 Starting Railway service...
- SERVICE_TYPE environment variable controls which service starts

Services:
- web: FastAPI + Telegram Bot
- worker: Celery Worker (background tasks)
- beat: Celery Beat (scheduler)
